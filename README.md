# Quantum-Feature-Selection-for-ML
A hybrid quantum computing-based approach for optimal feature selection in machine learning.
## Product Overview
Quantum Feature Selecton is hyrbid quantum computing approach to optimize feature selection in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model training and prediction. This solution approaches feature selection as an optimization problem and selects the most critical variables and eliminates the redundant and irrelevant ones. The solution increases the predictive power of machine learning applications, decreases over-fitting and reduces training time. 

## Product Highlight 

* Feature selection process is one of the main components of a feature engineering process. It increases the predictive capability and decreases computation of a  predictive model by reducing the number of input variables. This solution finds the minimal-optimal subset of features by maximizing relavancy and minimizing redudancy among features. Using this crucial component of machine learning, user's can eliminate the need of classical alternative feature selection methods like recursive feature selection and incorporate this one shot solution.
* The solution uses quantum hybrid solvers from D-Wave to reduce the time and space required while providing better quality results.
